""i maintain the view that japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,"" said economy minister heizo takenaka. but in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine.

2,"councils 'must find gypsy sites'. ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers, amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments. councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land. more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks, said housing minister yvette cooper. in november, mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3,500 travellers have no place to stop. ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. that scheme has paid out â£25m in four years, with â£8m available for 2005. ""there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites,"" said ms cooper. ""firstly, local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. and secondly, they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites. ""the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites, causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers. ""that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local"

""it's really a great start to the year no matter whether it's an exhibition or not. i was trying to play my best and i really did it,"" said dementieva. ""this will give me all the confidence before the grand slams. i was trying so hard to win this tournament."" williams, 24, was disappointed with her display.

3,"ferguson urges henry punishment. sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal's thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze. ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united's controversial win. the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy's foul on ashley cole for which he got a three-game ban. ""we shall present it to the fa and see what they do. the tackle on heinze was terrible,"" he said. clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. the clash occurred moments before half-time when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline. henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze's head. the striker protested his innocence - and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental. ferguson was also upset by arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behaviour.

""some people, they cannot play on clay. some people, they cannot play on a hard court. me, i can't play on grass."" however, safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles.

""the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season,"" he added. ""i was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20,000 fans turned up to watch. ""england were criticised for the 0-0 draw against holland - the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies.

""i've brought my family here and we've immersed ourselves in scottish life. there's no way that i'm walking away."" however, he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute. ""i'd like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation,"" he said. ""when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you, who are jealous and want to try to drag you down. ""when you have that situation, you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through.

3,"ireland surge past scots. ireland maintained their six nations grand slam ambitions with an impressive victory over scotland at murrayfield. hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time. a third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o'gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. after two hard-earned away victories, eddie o'sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. the home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. a powerful charge from flanker jason white was carried on by ali hogg and when ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, scotland kicked it to touch. the irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed paterson to stroke over a penalty"

""they cannot speak to us about blips because they're not in a better position than us,"" mourinho said. ""do they want to change positions with us? we are top of the league by nine points and in the carling cup final. ""the only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the fa cup.

""but, given the conditions and the standard of the croatian team, we should be very happy with the win."" the republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since kerr succeeded mick mccarthy. kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory.

""they can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort,"" he said. the posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an ir port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster.
