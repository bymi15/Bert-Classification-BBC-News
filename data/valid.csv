0,"us interest rates increased to 2%. us interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months, in a widely anticipated move. the federal reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the us economy is regaining steam. us companies created twice as many jobs as expected in october while exports hit record levels in september. analysts said a clear-cut victory for president bush in last week's election paved the way for a rise. another rise could be in store for december, some economists warned. the fed's open market committee - which sets interest rate policy in the us - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise. the fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rises in june, august and september. the central bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. the fed did not rule out raising rates once again in december but noted that any future increases would take place at a ""measured"" pace. in a statement, the fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained ""well contained"" while the us economy appeared"

2,"mps' murder sentence concern. murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new mps' report. the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse. ""the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor."" at present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims' relatives are unhappy. in july this year amanda champion's killer, james ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge. amanda's uncle, lewis champion, told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for"

2,"chancellor rallies labour voters. gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the ""stakes are too high"" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election. the chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 may - would give a ""clear and fundamental"" choice between labour investment and tory cuts. he told his party's spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win. the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under labour. to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre, mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, gp and nurse in the country. laying into the conservative's record in government he said: ""i give you this promise - with labour, britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, â£3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. ""never again tory boom and bust.

2,"brown targets oaps and homebuyers. gordon brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to â£120,000 as he put the economy at the heart of labour's election campaign. the chancellor also unveiled a one-off â£200 council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. mr brown put 1p a pint on beer, 4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until september. the tories called it a ""vote now, pay later"" budget. the lib dems branded it a ""sticking plaster"" for the election. tory leader michael howard predicted the budget would do nothing to help labour's ""faltering"" election campaign. ""this government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems britain faces,"" mr howard told mps. ""their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" he ended his response with an election challenge to labour, saying ""bring it on"". liberal democrat leader charles kennedy attacked mr brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice.

2,"ukip candidate suspended in probe. eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. john houston, 54, was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the british empire, were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip, soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said: ""we're looking for the resurrection of the british empire. ""the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston's reported views had been presented as ukip policy, which they were not. he said they might"
2,"new rules tackle 'sham weddings'. new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force. from tuesday, most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry. the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year. but immigrants' group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants (jcwi) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. when the changes were unveiled last year, immigration minister des browne said: ""our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages, while providing firm controls to prevent abuse."" under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office. but from tuesday all non-eu nationals, apart from citizens of switzerland, liechtenstein, iceland or norway, intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office 'certificate of marriage approval'. to get a certificate,"
2,"howard dismisses tory tax fears. michael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for â£4bn tax cuts are too modest. he defended the package, saying it was a plan for the tories' first budget and he hoped to be able to go further. the tories on monday highlighted â£35bn in ""wasteful"" spending they would stop to allow tax cuts, reduced borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats say the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party's mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals. now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted. tory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the financial times: ""i would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts."" interviewed on bbc radio 2's jeremy vine show, mr howard said: ""it is perfectly true that i am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much, much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts.

2,"labour accused of 'eu propaganda'. a ""taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise"" on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security, say the tories. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw, who accused the tories of ""running scared"" of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls, he argued. mr straw used thursday's commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005. security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july, said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to 1% of europe's economic output and were spent ""where it adds most value"". mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher, was ""fully justified"". ""we, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,"" he said. mr ancram condemned"

""if we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,"" he said. he added: ""it would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [west ham]"
2,"campbell: e-mail row 'silly fuss'. ex-no 10 media chief alastair campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at bbc journalists. mr campbell sent the missive by mistake to bbc2's newsnight after it sought to question his role in labour's controversial poster campaign. he later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a ""silly fuss"". mr campbell has recently re-joined labour's election campaign. the e-mail was revealed the day after peter mandelson, former labour minister and now a european commissioner, warned the bbc to steer away from ""demonising"" mr campbell. mr campbell messaged newsnight after the programme investigated claims that labour's advertising agency tbwa was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. the images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted tory leader michael howard as fagin, prompted accusations of anti-semitism, claims denied by labour. mr campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get trevor beattie, tbwa's boss, to issue a statement. in it, he said: ""just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together"

""far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" his party leader, michael howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending.

3,"tevez - an argentine in brazil. some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil. he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. he left an impression, but not for reasons he would have wanted. the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. even today, 'gandula' is the term used in brazil for ballboy. brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then, and many will delight now if history is repeated. another boca juniors player is coming to brazil. 'the new maradona' - carlos tevez - is joining corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. corinthians - or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez. it is particularly strange as - until last week - tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil, where the argentine championship is not shown. presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested"

4,"can yahoo dominate next decade?. yahoo has reached the grand old age of 10 and, in internet years, that is a long time. for many, yahoo remains synonymous with the internet - a veteran that managed to ride the dot-com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web's top brands. but for others there is another, newer net icon threatening to overshadow yahoo in the post dot-com world - google. the veteran and the upstart have plenty in common - yahoo was the first internet firm to offer initial public shares and google was arguably the most watched ipo (initial public offering) of the post-dot-com era. both began life as search engines although in 2000, when yahoo chose google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business, it was very much yahoo that commanded press attention. in recent years, the column inches have stacked up in google's favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as gmail, its shopping channel froogle and google news. for jupiter analyst olivier beauvillain, yahoo's initial decision to put its investment on search on hold was an error.

4,"net regulation 'still possible'. the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog ofcom has said. content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tv-quality video online becomes a norm. at a debate in westminster, the net industry considered the options. lord currie, chairman of super-regulator ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. at the debate, organised by the internet service providers' association (ispa), lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation. ""the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,"" he said. adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion. some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have"
