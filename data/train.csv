""price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn't grown as much as volumes,"" said investec economist david page. the figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked."

""an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,"" the authors say. the paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies"

0,"china keeps tight rein on credit. china's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report. the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. growth in china remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. rapid tooling-up of china's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. in theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a ""hard landing"" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. a low exchange rate - china's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets. china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level"

2,"lord scarman, 93, dies peacefully. distinguished lawyer lord scarman, who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 brixton riots, has died aged 93. the peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career, serving as law commission chairman in its first seven years. he also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in northern ireland. paying tribute, the lord chancellor lord falconer said lord scarman was one of the ""great advocates of our generation"". ""his legacy from his decisions in the lords and the court of appeal is substantial. ""his work in the wake of the brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none. ""a great judge, a great lawyer and a great man."" lord scarman's nephew george ritchie said the peer, who passed away peacefully on wednesday, would be ""sadly missed"". the lord chief justice, lord woolf, who is the most senior judge in england and wales, said it was lord scarman's ""pioneering work"" which paved the way for the human rights act 1998.

2,"kilroy unveils immigration policy. ex-chatshow host robert kilroy-silk has attacked uk policy on immigration saying britain's open door approach is hitting low wage ""indigenous"" workers. the veritas leader said the only people to benefit from immigrants from places like poland were employers, landlords, members of the 'metropolitan elite'. the mep said his party would only admit foreigners who were required because they had specific skills to offer. and he argued asylum cost â£2bn a year for 14,000 successful applicants. mr kilroy-silk said that worked out at â£143,000 per successful asylum seeker. he said veritas wanted to grant an amnesty for all those in britain claiming asylum and who have children and deport everyone else. britain should take its fair share of asylum seekers under the united nations convention on human rights, he argued. and mr kilroy-silk said he wanted to spend an extra â£500m a year to help provide for refugees abroad."
2,"analysis: no pain, no gain?. he called it his ""masochism strategy"" in the run-up to the iraq war and now tony blair has signed up for another dose of pain. the idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of ""real"" voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. the theory is that talking to the great british public, even if they are the ""great unwashed"", is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people's concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election. labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin, ""control freakery"" and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps. tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. mr blair's latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday. the trouble began"
2,"howard rebuts asylum criticisms. tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas. mr howard, whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called 'no more mr nasty'. tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would ""like to kick your cat"". ms robinson, a friend of the tory leader, also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was ""much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover"" - although she denied having personal experience. ""i wasn't at cambridge - and it's not personal experience - but i know people who were."" documentary maker michael cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country. he replies: ""what is the inference of that?

2,"donor attacks blair-brown 'feud'. the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds. duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its ""poor"" response to the asian tsunami crisis. his broadside came as ex-foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point. mr bannatyne has previously given labour â£50,000. he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs. the 52-year-old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues. his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives. robert peston's new book has prompted more speculation about the blair-brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. mr bannatyne said: ""disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country.

2,"strike threat over pension plans. millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer, warn union leaders. the cabinet office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system, prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. they believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made. it is thought the proposed overhaul, due on thursday, could mean pensions could be based on a ""career average"" salary. for each year served, staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next may. in a statement on sunday, the cabinet office said it was reviewing the civil service pension scheme, and hoped to announce proposals soon. ""unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes.

2,"brown shrugs off economy fears. gordon brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a â£1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave. in an upbeat pre-budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. the chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in uk ""industrial history"" but denied he was ""gloating"". but oliver letwin, for the tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing mr brown ""sir wastealot"". the shadow chancellor said mr brown's ""golden rule"" had ""turned to dross in his hands"" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling â£170bn. mr letwin told mps: ""the tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility. he is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer's money."" vincent cable, for the liberal democrats, accused mr brown of ducking tough choices. he said: ""last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency.

2,"tories reject rethink on axed mp. sacked mp howard flight's local conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election. russell tanguay, agent for arundel and south downs tories, said mr flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute. the news comes despite mr flight's allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate. mr flight landed in trouble over remarks on tory tax and spending plans. he quit as tory deputy chairman after apparently suggesting the tories planned extra spending cuts - but he wants to continue as an mp. tory headquarters says he cannot stand as a conservative candidate because he is no longer an approved candidate. mr tanguay backed that view on tuesday, saying: ""howard flight is ineligible to stand as a conservative party candidate. ""the association is in the process of selecting a new candidate."" but the local tory chairman made similar comments on friday and dissent continues. two local councillors who back mr flight met mr tanguay and the local association's chairman in arundel on tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting. mr flight says he will not stand down as"

2,"'no more concessions' on terror. charles clarke says he has ""no desire"" to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book. mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour's majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde, tory leader in the lords, said ministers should expect it to be ""substantially re-written"". the bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against. on monday, mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers"

""that's not only a moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is part of the essence of this country,"" he said. ""we want more migration, more people come to study and to work. ""we want more people coming to look for refuge."" mr blair's was asked last wednesday if the government's new immigration plans, including a point system for economic migrants, would reduce net migration. the prime minister told mps: ""the abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an"

""at a time when the british people are looking for more accountability and openness, this government turns its back on them; abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference - it does rather beg the question, 'what have they got to hide?'"" the general election is widely expected next may and all the parties are stepping up their campaign preparations. mr milburn said the economy would take centre stage in labour's campaign in what would be a ""watershed"" election and the ""last stand of the thatcherites"". mr milburn said"

2,"howard attacks 'pay later' budget. tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown's budget as ""vote now, pay later"" spending plans. the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor's ""sweeteners"", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said. labour's ""faltering election campaign"" would not be helped by the package of measures, mr howard added. mr brown's budget was not about what was good for the country, but ""all about the interests of the labour party,"" the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging ""millions of people in to the net"" to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax. ""we can all see the sweeteners, but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins."" he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced.

""i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,"" he said. the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed. stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue. mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. but he argued: ""we mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future.

""by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,"" said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. in a speech in london on monday, mr howard said: ""it's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling"

""if we don't like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the british people,"" he said. the home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his tory opposite number mr davis.

""that is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" mr brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of labour's programme. in a speech at edinburgh's napier university, he said labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for"

""we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france."" ms roche, labour mp for hornsey and wood green, believes legal migration is something we should welcome. she said her proposals mean ""we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like migration watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view."" she went on: ""what i would like to see is there being a body which"

""britain is heading in the wrong direction"", the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair's government was a ""bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals,"" he added. but labour's campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded: ""britain is working, don't let the tories wreck it again"". mr howard also paid tribute to the nation's character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, mr howard said. ""we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.

2,"plan to give elderly care control. elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans. ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. they also plan a supremo for adult services in each english area to get different agencies working together. but the government shunned opponents' calls for free long-term care. there are 1.7m people needing care in england and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. monday's consultation paper on social care for adults in england is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. health minister stephen ladyman said: ""this document is the antithesis of the nanny state. ""it's about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more."" the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been ""disappointing"". ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in"
2,"lib dems unveil women's manifesto. the liberal democrats are attempting to woo female voters with the launch of their manifesto for women. charles kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments. he also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free long-term care for the elderly. both labour and the conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support. mr kennedy says he wants to deal with policy areas that disadvantage women. ""two million pensioners in britain currently live below the government's own poverty line - two-thirds of whom are women,"" he said. he says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children. the lib dem's citizen's pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, mr kennedy argues. under the package, new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of â£170 a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child. mr kennedy also believes the party's plans to use the money saved from not introducing ""illiberal"" id cards to boost"

2,"nuclear strike 'key terror risk'. the uk and us must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes, says a top academic. amitai etzioni, a key influence on new labour thinking, says the us emphasis on an ""axis of evil"" is misplaced. the priority should instead be on ""failing states"", including russia and pakistan, who cannot properly control their nuclear material, he argues. his report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology. professor etzioni was a senior adviser to president carter's white house and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of blairite third way politics. in a report for the foreign policy centre think tank, he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations. ""attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work, nor can one rely on pre-emption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack,"" he says. that means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists' access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them.

2,"'debate needed' on donations cap. a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a â£10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost â£68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly â£12m of them from individual gifts worth more than â£1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.

2,"labour pig poster 'anti-semitic'. the labour party has been accused of anti-semitism over a poster depicting michael howard and oliver letwin - who are both jewish - as flying pigs. prospective tory candidate andrew mennear, whose finchley constituency contains a large jewish community, branded it ""tasteless"" and offensive. the poster shows the two men's faces superimposed on winged pigs and says ""the day the tory sums add up"". labour said the poster was ""not anti-jewish, but anti-tory"". it is one of four designs e-mailed to labour members, who were asked to vote for their favourite. mr mennear, who was sent the e-mail by a friend, said he had been ""shocked"" by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified. he said there was nothing more distasteful for a jewish person than to be associated with a pig. ""i am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent, but these sort of things can cause great offence. it clearly wasn't thought through.

2,"uk 'discriminated against roma'. the government's immigration rules racially discriminated against roma (gypsies) seeking entry into the uk, the law lords have ruled. it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people, mostly roma, from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital, prague. civil rights group liberty said it exposed ""racism at the heart of the government's asylum policy"". the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. it said it would look at the implications of the ruling, but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe. the screening took place at the airport in july 2001, at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain. those refused ""pre-clearance"" were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk, because no airline would carry them. lady hale, sitting with lords bingham, steyn, hope and carswell, said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution. but she said they were treated more sceptically than non-roma passengers by immigration officers ""acting on racial grounds"". lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the"

2,"defection timed to hit tax pledge. with impeccable and precisely-calculated timing, tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard's latest announcement on taxation and spending. with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election, mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories' resolutely depressing poll showings. the big idea is his â£35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts. and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one's breakfast with frost programme. he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now, but without any concrete pledges. but mr howard announced that, of the â£35bn he has earmarked from savings, â£12bn will be used to plug labour's claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin's first budget. he would not be precise, but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or"

""he fully supports the party's policies on, and approach to, the public services,"" said the statement. ""however, in order to avoid any further misrepresentation of his views and any damage to the party, he has decided not to stand in the sedgefield constituency at the next election."" mr kruger is continuing in his job at the tory campaign headquarters. labour election coordinator alan milburn claimed mr kruger had exposed the tory agenda for â£35bn of cuts to public services. mr milburn said: ""he is not some unknown hopeful fighting an unwinnable seat. he"
2,"'no uk apology' for colonial past. the days of britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over, gordon brown has said. the chancellor, speaking during a week-long tour of africa, said it was time to talk about enduring british values of liberty and tolerance. mr brown has signed a debt relief deal with tanzania which could cost the uk â£1 billion. south african president thabo mbeki has attacked british imperialists, saying they treated africans like savages. mr brown said that missionairies had come to africa because of their sense of duty. he added that the history of internationalism and enterprise had given britain a greater global reach than any other country. bbc political correspondent mark mardell said britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor's but ""never before has he been so outspoken in defending britain's past history"". the uk has pledged to pay 10% of the developing world's foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty. on top of the relief deal with tanzania mr brown said the uk would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world. under the plan - which could cost the uk â£1bn - countries must spend the cash saved on health, education and"

2,"plaid mp's cottage arson claim. a plaid cymru mp believes uk security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on welsh extremists. it is 25 years since the start of 12 years of fire-bombings, attributed to a shadowy group known as meibion glyndwr. plaid cymru's elfyn llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved, with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote. ex-welsh office minister lord roberts of conwy denied security services were involved. in march this year, north wales police reopened the case, saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield dna evidence. meibion glyndwr - which means ""sons of glyndwr"" - began burning property in december 1979 in protest at homes in rural wales being sold as holiday cottages to people from england. the group was linked to most of the 220 or so fire-bombing incidents stretching from the llyn peninsula to pembrokeshire. the campaign continued until the early 1990s. police were accused in some quarters of targeting anyone who was a nationalist. although one man, sion aubrey roberts, was convicted in 1993 of sending letter bombs in the post, the arson cases remain unsolved. as a solicitor, elfyn llwyd represented welsh singer"
2,"sayeed to stand down as tory mp. tory mp jonathan sayeed is to stand down on the grounds of ill health. the decision comes after mr sayeed survived an attempt to de-select him in a row over allegations he had profited from private tours of parliament. the mid-bedfordshire mp had denied a claim that he was paid for guiding visitors around the palace of westminster. conservative leader michael howard has now accepted the mp's resignation, it has been announced. mr sayeed was suspended from parliament for two weeks last month after the commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen ""well below the standards expected"". the conservative party had already been withdrawn the whip for a month. but his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him, with mr sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes. after the vote, mr sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election. but the vote prompted constituency association president sir stanley odell to resign in protest. the standards and privileges committee inquiry was launched after the sunday times alleged english manner limited charged clients for access to westminster through mr sayeed. mr sayeed had"

2,"clarke plans migrant point scheme. anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, home secretary charles clarke has said. he is proposing a points system similar to australia's but would avoid the quota system planned by the tories. mr clarke, who will unveil his plans on monday, said economic migration helped the uk but ""needed proper policing"". the lib dems say they will look at his plans, but tory liam fox said his party offered a ""clear choice"" on the issue. the conservative party co-chairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had ""done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit"" on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas. the home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken, to ""ensure we can know everybody who is in the country"". speaking on bbc one's breakfast with frost, he said ""economic migrants are of great value to this country"", but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a ""burden on society"". he said: ""we will establish"
2,"uk plan to deport terror suspects. deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death. home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at belmarsh prison, london, and woodhill, milton keynes, was unlawful. the 12 affected by the ruling are from algeria, tunisia, egypt and jordan. the government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws. mr clarke told the times: ""i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come."" he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw ""in a very positive way"". mr clarke said that he was seeking ""memorandums of understanding"" between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. however, he added: ""i do not think the solution to the law lords' judgement for this government is in"
2,"campaign 'cold calls' questioned. labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing ""cold calls"". the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. the information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but there is a ""grey"" area if personal data is kept. telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications. the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps. a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about"
2,"mandelson warns bbc on campbell. the bbc should steer away from ""demonising"" ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell, peter mandelson has said. the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour ""dirty tricks"" campaign. that charge was denied by mr mandelson, who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell's campaigning skills. he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before. that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street ""sexed up"" iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier. the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies, director-general greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan. labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howard's past. mr mandelson, a former labour communications director, told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills.

2,"tory backing for id cards. the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards. the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a ""tough meeting"" where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the bbc. the bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats. they have said the scheme is ""deeply flawed"" and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards, and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been ""agnostic"" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards, the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected.

""forward"" is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and, along with ""not back"", is set against a mushy pea green background. as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared, it was all very post modern, or something. great use of colour. those ad men really do earn their money. and, coincidentally, the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called ""fagin"" posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but, as election supremo alan milburn declared, ""are doing a very good job"". mr milburn, in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning, explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony"
2,"retirement age could be scrapped. the ""myth that ageing is a barrier"" to contributing to society needs to be ""exploded"", the work and pensions minister has said. this was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely, alan johnson said. it was also committed to ""stamping out"" age discrimination and would outlaw it, he told a conference on ageing. all three parties have been wooing older voters with both the tories and lib dems pledging higher pensions. mr johnson told age concern's age agenda in london the government was ""seriously considering"" introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. this idea has been adopted by the lib dems as policy, while the tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions. mr johnson's speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country's pension system. this would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women, he said. speaking at the london conference he said: ""generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination"". the government wanted to tackle"
2,"minimum wage increased to â£5.05. the minimum wage will rise in october, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced. adults must be paid at least â£5.05 an hour, up from â£4.85, while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid â£4.25. the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. businesses wanted it frozen, warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a â£6 rate. a further increase in the adult rate to â£5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for october 2006. according to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage ""challenging"". ""we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings, and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact,"" said chairman adair turner. the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing. unveiling the latest increase, mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a ""symbol of decency and fairness"".

2,"anglers 'could face prosecution'. anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of mps has warned. sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said. the mps said they were ""concerned"" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, mps said. they called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect ""kept animals"" and ""companion"" animals by setting up a ""duty of care"". in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing ""mutilation"" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest. the environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from"
2,"jamieson issues warning to bigots. scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches. cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. she praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. however, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. the sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue. they plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs, church leaders, senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. speaking on bbc radio scotland's sunday live programme, ms jamieson described friday's meeting as ""very productive"" and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. ms jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but"
2,"custody death rate 'shocks' mps. deaths in custody have reached ""shocking"" levels, a committee of mps and peers has warned. the joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems. members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals. there was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, mps said. the report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate ""amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group"". many of those who ended up taking their own lives had ""presented themselves"" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said. it questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided. increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said. committee chairman labour mp jean corston said: ""each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the"
2,"lib dems target the student vote. students can decide the fate of mps in some seats at the next election, liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has claimed. the party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll. the figures assume all students will vote in their university town. in fact, some may vote where the parents live. the lib dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support. but the tories would also end fees and labour says both would cap people's ambitions. the lib dems have named the 14 seats where there are enough students to take the lib dems from second place to beat labour, and the 13 where they could go from second to beat the tories. launching his campaign to win students' votes at the london school of economics, mr kennedy urged students to ""make their mark"". he underlined lib dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to â£2,000. he said: ""top-up fees put students off university, especially those from a poorer background.

2,"ministers 'naive' over phone-taps. the government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior eu politician says. javier solana, eu foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries. human rights groups, top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. mr solana told itv1's jonathan dimbleby programme: ""[phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. ""it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal."" mr solana's comments come the day after sir ian blair, the newly-appointed metropolitan police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence. under the anti-terrorism crimes and security act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge. several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court. some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. human rights group liberty has argued that if"

2,"tory leader unveils spending plan. tory leader michael howard says his party can save â£35bn in government spending by tackling waste. the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps, robert jackson, a former minister, to labour. mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. ""let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did"", he told bbc 1's breakfast with frost programme. however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives' spending plans. fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday. the bulk of the â£35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, mr howard said. the â£12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. however, the remainder would deal with some of the ""unfair taxes"". ""almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher"
2,"lords wrong on detainees - straw. jack straw has attacked the decision by britain's highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws. the foreign secretary said the right to life was the ""most important liberty"" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. law lords were ""simply wrong"" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. new home secretary charles clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed. the house of lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy. but mr straw denied it amounted to a ""constitutional crisis"". he said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. ""the law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,"" he told bbc radio 4's today programme. the foreign secretary insisted it was for parliament, and not judges, to decide how best britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism."

""delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the millennium village and elsewhere on the peninsula,"" he said. but edward leigh, who is chairman of the commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the dome deal. he said:"

2,"peers debate crown succession law. peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne. labour peer lord dubs' succession to the crown bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. the private member's bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. the fabian society's sundar katwala said the change was ""long overdue"" and that he expected a ""warm response"". the political reform group's general secretary told bbc radio 4's today programme there were some ""very out-dated features"" at the heart of britain's constitution. ""in 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures. ""we hope they are warm towards it and don't say this is the wrong time."" he pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill. mr katwala added: ""this is long overdue. parliament will have to do it eventually, the government, and i hope all of the political parties, might think this is a very simple"
2,"galloway plea for hostage release. ex-labour mp george galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker margaret hassan, kidnapped in iraq. mrs hassan, 59, who led care international operations in iraq, was abducted in baghdad on 19 october. mr galloway was expelled from the labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on iraq. he denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the al-jazeera arabic television channel. speaking in london on saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party, the respect coalition, he said: ""i have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations. ""but this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions. ""i am prepared to do anything i can to help save her life."" a spokesman later said mr galloway had friends in common with ms hassan, who he described as a prominent anti-war activist, and that he was ""willing to do anything - go to iraq or be an intermediary or anything that's necessary"". since her abduction, several videos of mrs hassan have been broadcast by al-jazeera. the latest footage showed mrs hassan asking for british"
2,"observers to monitor uk election. ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming uk general election is fairly run. the move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. a report by two mps committees called on thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. but in a written response to labour mp gordon prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any uk election. junior constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said: ""i fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced."" the government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001. but trial all-postal ballots in four english regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. liberal democrat peer lord greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges ""on a scale not seen since the 19th century"". thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) and the department for"

2,"clarke to unveil immigration plan. new controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on monday. home secretary charles clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers. tony blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no ""magic bullet"". the tories say labour is acting too late while the lib dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system. the government's new five-year plan is designed to show how labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in may. ministers deny they have been spurred into action by tory campaigning or because the prime minister is worried too little has been done. instead, they say the plans are part of an ""evolving"" process aimed at winning public confidence. mr clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants' families, and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants. the prime minister on sunday said immigration would be ""toughened up"" to ensure only those immigrants with skills the uk really needs will be granted work permits."
2,"ukip candidate suspended. eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. john houston, 54, was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the british empire, were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip, soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said: ""we're looking for the resurrection of the british empire. ""the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston's reported views had been presented as ukip policy, which they were not. he said they might"

2,"kennedy criticises 'unfair' taxes. gordon brown has failed to tackle the ""fundamental unfairness"" in the tax system in his ninth budget, charles kennedy has said. how was it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20%, the lib dem leader asked. the new â£200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the ""unfair tax"", he added. the government could not go on ""patching up"" the system, he added. speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election, mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world. but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation. he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation. the chancellor's announcement that he was to offer a â£200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a ""sticking plaster"" to a much bigger problem. the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than"
2,"straw attacked on china arms. moves to lift the european union's ban on arms exports to china have been condemned by human rights groups and the conservatives. the 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of china's crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square in 1989. uk foreign secretary jack straw, who will hold talks in beijing on thursday, said an eu arms code was more effective than the current ban. but human rights watch says the eu is putting commerce above abuse concerns. in december, the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. germany and france have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. britain has been more cautious but mr straw last week said he also wanted it to end, despite us objections. he expects it to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics. brad adams, from human rights watch, said: ""this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square. ""there are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for."" mr straw said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as"
2,"ukip outspent labour on eu poll. the uk independence party outspent both labour and the liberal democrats in the european elections, new figures show. ukip, which campaigned on a slogan of ""say no to europe"", spent â£2.36m on the campaign - second only to the conservatives' â£3.13m. the campaign took ukip into third place with an extra 10 meps. labour's campaign cost â£1.7m, the lib dems' â£1.19m and the greens' â£404,000, according to figures revealed by the electoral commission on wednesday. much of the ukip funding came from yorkshire millionaire sir paul sykes, who helped bankroll the party's billboard campaign. critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes. but a ukip spokesman said labour and the conservatives had spent â£10m between them on the last general election. ""with the advantages of public money the others have, the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space,"" he added."
2,"chancellor rallies labour voters. gordon brown has issued a rallying cry, telling supporters the ""stakes are too high"" to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election. the chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 may - will give a ""clear and fundamental"" choice between labour investment and conservative cuts. speaking at labour's spring conference in gateshead, mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands. he said tory plans to cut â£35bn tax would ""cut deep into public service"". to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, gp and nurse in the country, he told activists. laying into the conservative's record in government he said: ""i give you this promise - with labour, britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, â£3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.

2,"ministers deny care sums 'wrong'. ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated. a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure. the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the ""care development group"" of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings, according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university's fraser of allander institute. ""dubious"" assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another â£130m by 2022, the report warned. it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert. but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland: ""we don't think we got our sums wrong.

2,"'debate needed' on donations cap. a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a â£10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost â£68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly â£12m of them from individual gifts worth more than â£1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.

2,"report attacks defence spending. the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects. a national audit office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by â£1.7bn in the past year. it says there is ""little evidence"" the mod's performance had improved, despite the introduction of a ""smart acquisition"" policy six years ago. a senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned. the nao's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach â£50bn - 14% higher than originally planned. the total delays amounted to 62 months, with average individual delays rising by three months. sir john bourn, head of the nao, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. ""many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,"" the report says. the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older ""legacy projects"", such as the eurofighter. a senior defence official, speaking to the bbc's defence correspondent paul"

""there are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of british and american troops in iraq feeds the insurgency,"" he said. ""there is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces."" mr kennedy pointed out that the netherlands, portugal and the czech republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal ""regardless of the situation on the ground"". he accused mr blair's government of ""being less than straightforward"" over its plans. ""next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections"

""they are turned off by the way we do politics in britain. there's a message there for politicians."" he urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to ""speak more from the heart"".

2,"blair backs 'pre-election budget'. tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown's pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy. in a speech in edinburgh, the prime minister said thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises. he told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing. ""that is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" mr brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of labour's programme. in a speech at edinburgh's napier university, he said labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for"

""there are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,"" he declared."

2,"falconer rebuts 'charade' claims. concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" were not a political ploy, the lord chancellor has said. ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday. lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear. the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. critics fear it could allow ""killing by omission"" through withdrawing treatment, including food and fluids. tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland.

2,"probe launched on ken nazi jibe. an investigation by the standards board is under way following allegations that ken livingstone has brought his office into disrepute. the probe follows the london mayor's comments to a jewish journalist comparing him to a concentration camp guard, after a party about a week ago. the local government watchdog also said the allegation related to a failure to respect others. it has the power to suspend or bar labour's mr livingstone from office. a complaint was made to the body by the board of deputies of british jews and the commission for racial equality. speaking after the investigation was announced bob neill, leader of the london assembly conservatives, said: ""he has behaved in a manner unbecoming of his office and in so doing, has shown extraordinarily poor civic leadership. ""his administration is now in crisis."" on sunday, deputy mayor nicky gavron told the bbc's politics show she believed the mayor of london would say sorry on tuesday for offending the wider jewish community. the prime minister tony blair is among those who have called for an apology but so far the mayor has refused. the mayor accused oliver finegold, of the evening standard newspaper, of ""doorstepping"" him at a ""predominately"

""we want michael to be as accessible as possible,"" mr fox said, adding that the party was not afraid of scrutiny. the tory leader wanted to meet as many ordinary members of the public, mr fox said. tony blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign. but labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for mr blair to hold a daily news conference. mr fox responded by accusing the prime minister of ""hiding away from the scrutiny of london's media"". the liberal democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with charles kennedy. on mrs howard's role, mr fox said: ""sandra has already been campaigning with michael on a number of visits and has been undertaking short visits herself. ""that pattern will continue. it's"
2,"kennedy's cautious optimism. charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election. in his 22 years in the commons, he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and, he might say, the uk's political and electoral system. but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months' time. ""look, i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around,"" he said. he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort. and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the ""real"" opposition. but doesn't that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second? he is prepared to go this far: ""a clear conclusion has been reached, including by conservatives, that the conservatives are not going to win this election.

2,"manchester wins labour conference. the labour party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in manchester and not blackpool, it has been confirmed. the much trailed decision was ratified by labour's ruling national executive committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. it will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event. blackpool will get the much smaller february spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move. for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool, bournemouth and brighton. and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. in 1998 the party said it would not return to blackpool but did so in 2002. the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference. colin asplin, blackpool hotel association said: ""we have tried very hard to make sure they come back to blackpool.

2,"bid to cut court witness stress. new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor. lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates' courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. it is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system. ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. launching the department for constitutional affairs' plan, lord falconer said: ""one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims. ""the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.

""what we want is for more people to earn and own,"" mr milburn told bbc radio 4's today show. tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin called labour ""a brilliant machine for talking about things"" but said it did not deliver policies the country needs. meanwhile, the liberal democrats' president simon hughes said: ""new labour has lost people's confidence in a way old labour never did."" mr milburn told today that labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in britain. pressed on incapacity benefits, he said the tax and welfare system must ""provide the right incentives to people"".

2,"mps criticise child access system. divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system, mps have said. the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, mps said. but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access. currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. ""an arbitrary 'template' imposed on all families, whatever the needs of the child, would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position,"" the mps said. they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. this would ""reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety"", they said. delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders"

""i just don't think labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a conservative."" he denied this strategy was opportunism, insisting the lib dem's policies on issues such as tuition fees, the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed ""to all sides of the political"

""that's a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so i think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint."" mr mccabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years. he told bbc radio scotland's sunday live programme: ""here in scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.

""there's been no contact. we don't want to lose him."" real madrid general manager arrigo sacchi is the driving force behind the move, convincing vice-president emilio butragueno and new coach wanderley luxemburgo that gravesen is the right man for the bernabeu. everton must weigh up whether it is worth taking the money on offer"

""a lot of people want the club's interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart,"" said ferdinand. ""no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table."" the central defender added on bbc radio five live: ""we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with. ""i would like to see the situation resolved either way. ""i think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals.

""the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer."
3,"a november to remember. last saturday, one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world. that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham. but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level, at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion, with australia's triumph in london followed by france's capitulation to new zealand. ""clearly, there is no number one side in the world at the moment,"" declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney. ""there are four, five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%."" while that bodes well for rugby as a whole, it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies, all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year, europe's finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first"
3,"sella wants michalak recall. former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland. sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date. but he told bbc sport: ""michalak is the answer both now and for the future. delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak. ""he does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset ireland."" the 22-year-old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season. with michalak overlooked, the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales. ""the wales game was amazing to watch but never did i think the french could lose that game at half-time,"" said sella. ""their only mistakes were that they didn't score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit."" sella, however, insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire laporte, despite the defeat at the stade de france.

""in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players, calling them cheats, so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself,"" ferguson said on saturday. ""he ran at me with hands raised saying 'what do you want to do about it?' ""to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager"
3,"bell set for england debut. bath prop duncan bell has been added to england's 30-man squad to face ireland in the rbs six nations. and with phil vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and julian white out with a neck injury, bell could make his england debut. bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with wales. but last december, the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row. but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell - who was among the tryscorers when england a beat france a 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. robinson also has an injury worry over centre olly barkley, who withdrew from bath's starting line-up to face gloucester last weekend. he was due to have a hospital scan on monday, while gloucester centre henry paul, who started at fly-half against bath, limped out at kingsholm because of an ankle problem. despite barkley's three missed penalties"
3,"federer claims dubai crown. world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic. top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. but ljubicic, who beat tim henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. the match was a re-run of last week's final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam, where federer triumphed, but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets. ""i really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and i did, and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,"" federer said. ""that took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back, and that was a good effort on his side."" ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first"

""i have signed a five-month contract with bolton,"" said candela, who will travel to england on tuesday. ""in june i will decide whether to continue to play for bolton or retire from professional football."" allardyce hopes candela's arrival will relieve bolton's injury crisis after defender nicky hunt limped out injured during oldham's 1-0 win against oldham in the fa cup on sunday. ""in light of what has happened to nicky hunt, with his injury, it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back,"" allardyce said. ""he has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the world cup in 1998.

3,"white admits to balco drugs link. banned american sprinter kelli white says she knowingly took steroids given to her by bay area lab co-operative (balco) president victor conte. conte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion, and white said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing. ""he's the one who told me that it wasn't what he said it was,"" white said in the san francisco chronicle. but she added: ""it was my decision to go to him, not anybody else's."" white said conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil, only to change his story later. white failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships. she was subsequently handed a two-year ban in may this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. at first, white claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.

3,"collins banned in landmark case. sprinter michelle collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the north american court of arbitration for sport (cas). america's former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the balco doping scandal. the 33-year-old was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. the us anti-doping agency (usada) decided to press charges against collins in the summer. the sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the cas has upheld usada's findings. ""the usada has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that collins took epo, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and thg,"" said a cas statement. ""collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time."" so far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the balco doping scandal. world record holder tim montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the usada. his hearing before the csa has been rescheduled for june next year. drug enforcement chiefs in the us have vowed to"

""it was definitely a learning curve and i certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,"" said the east kilbride athlete. the race was won by felipe vivancos, who equalled the spanish record. sweden's robert kronberg was second, with haiti's dudley dorival in third. scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. he won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first iaaf indoor grand prix circuit final. ""i should have done better than that,"" he said. ""i felt i could have won it. i got a poor start - but i still felt i should have ran faster."" vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while kronberg and dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively."
3,"borders 19-20 ulster. ulster clung on for a morale-boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night. a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the scottish side could not complete the fightback. ulster had led 20-6 with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham. but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by charlie hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. substitute joe pattison - who had come on for the injured gareth morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase. the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving adam larkin an easy conversion. ally warnock clawed back three points for borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. first, mark blair was yellow carded for killing"

""i felt a little better sunday morning but decided i'd only run in the main race. then everything went perfectly."" gardener, part of the great britain 4x100m quartet that won gold at the athens olympics, will now turn his attention to next weekend's norwich union european indoor trials in sheffield.

""i think i played better than against greg rusedski and i am happy i am playing so well,"" said the top seed. lopez showed glimpses of resolve early in the second set when he held his first service game and came close to breaking federer. but the swiss saved a break point and promptly broke serve in the following game to seize control. davydenko, meanwhile, upset french third seed sebastien grosjean 2-6 6-3 6-2. fabrice santoro completed a miserable day for france when he was forced to retire when 6-2 3-0 down to albert costa. spaniard costa will next face croatian ivan ljubicic after the sixth seed beat rafael nadal 6-2 6-7 (3/7) 6-3."

""should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction, as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made, it would be the end of the matter."" kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in england's 19-13 defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was ""very disappointed"" with robinson's remarks."
3,"edgy agassi struggles past dent. andre agassi put in an erratic display before edging into the fourth round of the australian open with victory over taylor dent. the 34-year-old american, seeded eighth, made a poor start, dropping serve early on and later needing two chances to serve out the set. having secured the lead, agassi still failed to take control as both players forced a succession of breaks. but agassi won the tie-break before wrapping up a 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 win. fourth seed survived an injury scare as he battled past mario ancic 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4. the russian turned his right ankle in the third game of the fourth set and called for treatment immediately. but he showed no sign of the problem when he returned to the court to wrap up victory in two hours 45 minutes. ancic, wimbledon semi-finalist in 2004, looked set to push safin all the way when he took the second set but safin raised his game to sink the croatian. safin said he was trying to keep his temper under control at this year's tournament. the russian hit himself on the head repeatedly in one second-set outburst but was otherwise largely calm in his victory.

""that's not good enough for a striker at a club like this.

3,"time to get tough on friendlies?. for an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players. the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end. i would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let"

""my hip was cramping and i just could not continue,"" said the 34-year-old. agassi, who has won the australian open four times, will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage. he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year.

""that wasn't comfortable out there at all, what i was feeling. ""i have to wait and see what i'm dealing with - it's a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesn't feel right and is getting worse.

""i'm extremely disappointed. i don't know if there's a lot to add to that,"" said rangers manager alex mcleish of novo's punishment. ""but what i will say is that i'm at a loss as to why that incident should be picked up and highlighted when there were so many other incidents during the game."" both players will miss this weekend's games when celtic host dundee united and rangers visit kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal. the additional bans come into effect from 28 december meaning camara will also be unavailable for the home game against livingston while novo will miss the meetings with dundee united and dunfermline. an sfa spokesman said: ""they have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend"

""i've started back and i'm thoroughly enjoying it. i'm looking forward to it. i've got to run under 10 seconds (for 100m) and under 20 seconds (for 200m)."" campbell was part of the british quartet who shocked the americans to win relay gold in athens in august. the newport-based athlete and team-mates jason gardener, marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis were rewarded with mbes in the new year honours list. campbell's relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual 100m and 200m events in athens, when he failed to reach the finals. the 31-year-old, who won olympic 200m silver in sydney in 2000, said during the games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best. he was criticised at the time by former olympic champion michael johnson, who cast doubt on campbell's injury"

""but it wouldn't have that same sweet feeling at chelsea, where it's all money-orientated and about simply buying the best."" thompson reacted sharply to some liverpool supporters, who criticised gerrard's performance in the carling cup final against chelsea. a number of fans questioned gerrard's commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in liverpool's 3-2 defeat as his first goal for chelsea. thompson added: ""i heard those comments from so-called supporters and they were diabolical, absolutely outrageous. ""stevie carried the club last year and this year. he's always put liverpool first."" thompson, who savoured seven title-winning seasons and two european cup triumphs during his anfield playing career, is confident that the lure of champions league football will keep gerrard at anfield.

""[i'm] absolutely spitting. i'm livid. there's two tries we've been cost,"" robinson told bbc sport. ""we've got to go back to technology. i don't know why we didn't."" south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the sale wing to gather. kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try. ""i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey,"" said robinson. ""it is how we use the technology. it is there, and it should be used. ""i am still trying to work out the cueto try. i have looked at both, and they both looked tries.

""carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,"" said villa boss david o'leary. ""i won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. whether he has an operation has got to be left to chelsea."" cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because o'leary had a shortage of strikers. the return to fitness of darius vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of luke moore has alleviated some of the villa's manager's problems in that department."

""i hope i can contribute to the planning and preparation, and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself,"" he said. ""i am also looking forward to going out for the later stages of the tour."" woodward's decision to call in prime minister tony blair's former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last lions tour of australia in 2001, when new zealander graham henry was the head coach. the furore surrounding the newspaper diaries of matt dawson and austin healey was compounded by other disillusioned players venting their frustration through the media. ""the lions is a massive media event,"" said woodward, who will be the head coach. ""there will be a huge level of interest from the travelling media, the fans that will go out in their thousands and the new zealand public.

""david is a successful businessman and i thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level, it was him."" mackay's executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee, which contains members elected by scotland's club sides. ""he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can't be run by amateurs,"" said calder. ""in fact, i don't understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived. ""but i don't believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down.

""we lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything."" real's finish as runners-up in their champions league group means they cannot face his old club manchester united in the next round. but real could be drawn against other premiership hopefuls, arsenal or chelsea, who won their respective groups.

""i'm very happy with his contribution and i think he's good enough to play for another couple of years."" dawson played a vital part in england's world cup win last year but has fallen out of favour with new coach andy robinson after missing a training session in september. however he hopes the new deal will help him regain his england place. ""rugby is still my priority and there's still a burning desire within me to play the best rugby i possibly can,"" he said. ""i know within myself, if i was given the chance i could play for england again. ""i know i'm fit enough, i'm strong enough, i'm skilful enough."""

""i think this award reinforces what we did on that fantastic night,"" he said. ""this recognition is really inspiring and makes me want to have more success,"" said lewis-francis. the british sprint quartet produced a string of faultless baton changes in the final to put pressure on the americans. and when the usa stumbled with a poor switch between justin gatlin and coby miller at the 300m stage, britain edged ahead going into the final bend. then, on cue, lewis-francis ran a textbook final leg, holding off maurice greene to bring team gb home in 38.07 seconds - just one hundredth of a second ahead of their rivals. ""winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far,"" said the birchfield harrier.

""we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage,"" tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester. ""at the moment, there are still a lot of unknowns about andy farrell, not least his medical situation. ""whoever does take him on is going to take a big, big gamble."" farrell, who has had persistent knee problems, had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months. leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game. if he does move across to union, wells believes he would better off playing in the backs, at least initially. ""i'm sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre,"" said wells. ""i think england would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league"

""it's an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side, but it will be a massive honour."" coach mike ruddock says the 24-year-old should take the armband from broken thumb victim thomas against scotland. ruddock praised owen's contribution as vice-captain and pack leader in this year's wins over england, italy and france, notably his role in the second-half in paris following thomas' injury. the 22-cap dragons man says that thomas will be badly missed, though. ""gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain,"" said owen. ""he has put his own unique stamp on things. we are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like kevin morgan to step in."" owen admitted the grand slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no-one"

""i'm delighted to have won against such a good opponent in a tournament of this importance,"" said soderling. ""i was really on form, my service was good and i really liked playing on the synthetic surface."" soderling, the world number 37, shrugged off a nervous start to take the opening set on his first set point. a change in approach from fourth seed stepanek in the second set paid dividends as he took it on a tie-break, but soderling's superior power proved too much in the third."

""they have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years."" white is also impressed with the welsh pack's strength in depth. ""gethin jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. he has played a bit at tight-head but i think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good,"" he added. the 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world. he destroyed south africa's os du randt in the scrum at twickenham last autumn to give england the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. leicester, who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by white's"

""we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack. we are pleased but move on to the next game."" igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso, and benitez said: ""he played very well. ""it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level."" benitez added: ""it is all back in our own hands now, it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen.

""let's be realistic, there are some fantastic teams left in the champions league,"" he told bbc radio five live. ""we are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year."" gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in europe's premier club competition. last season he described qualification for the champions league as the ""be all and end all"" - and rumours persist that he will leave anfield if the reds fail to secure a place in the competition. he has consistently been linked with a move away from liverpool, with chelsea the favourites to snap up the england midfielder. and blues boss jose mourinho backed gerrard's view that rafael benitez's team could struggle to progress this season. ""rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team, maybe he's a little bit behind (right now),"" he"
3,"radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs. paula radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals. the marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the ""suspicions and innuendoes"" which greet any fast time. ""doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such,"" the 30-year-old told the sunday times. ""it not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters, sponsors and the general public."" radcliffe's comments come at a time when several american sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use. ""being caught in possession of a performance-enhancing drugs should carry a penalty,"" she added. ""the current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes. ""this means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field, if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route. ""often, when an athlete puts in a good performance, they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise.

""michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we're monitoring him,"" he told bbc newcastle. ""he is a great centre-forward and only 25 but i don't think we're the only ones monitoring the situation at real."" souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburn's club scoring record may influence the striker's decision. milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957, while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name. ""without giving too much away, i am confident he will be here next season,"" said souness. ""i can't imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburn's scoring record."" souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window. the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the"

""drogba trained on monday with no problems and will do the same on tuesday. gallas feels he can play and wants to play. we are protecting him still but he will be okay to play."" drogba, chelsea's â£24m striker, has missed the last three weeks through injury. cech, ferreira, carvalho, terry, gallas, tiago, makelele, lampard, cole, drogba, gudjohnsen."

""i think it's fantastic for ollie,"" tigers coach john wells told bbc radio leicester.

""the referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time,"" said an fa statement. it means united's win will pass off without further intervention from the governing body, whose new chief executive brian barwick was in the highbury stands.

""we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. that is the end of it."" mourinho was concerned that ferguson's conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official.

""i had three chances to win the game but didn't. we have work to do after this but we never take a victory over england lightly."" ireland hooker shane byrne echoed o'gara's comments but admitted the game had been england's best outing in the six nations. byrne said: ""it was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard. ""we just had to stick to our defensive pattern, trust ourselves and trust those around us. all round it was fantastic."" ireland captain brian o'driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said: ""we are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. ""we did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you've just got to jump"

""schalk's emergence as a major force has meant a lot to south african rugby, but has also influenced world rugby,"" said white.

""somebody, i think it was mr phillips, said they won't have money for flowers at wimbledon. that's insulting."" an all england club spokesperson denied phillips made the remark, insisting: ""he definitely didn't say it."" the statement added: ""it was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the wimbledon grounds."" davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week's dubai duty free event will join the us and australian opens in offering equal prize money for women.

""but you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level. ""i have confidence that we can complete the task in germany. i am always confident and we must be positive."" benitez defended goalkeeper jerzy dudek, whose failure to hold on to dimitar berbatov's weak drive allowed franca to score with the last kick of the game - and give the german team a lifeline for the second leg. ""for me it was not jerzy dudek's fault,"" added benitez. ""he had played a very good game - and had we scored our other chances, nobody would be talking about about their goal. it would not have mattered. ""if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal. ""in my opinion jerzy played well, made two very fine saves - and i am happy with him.

""i know what it takes and what i have to offer,"" he told the daily telegraph. dallaglio toured south africa with the lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to australia three years ago. the 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life. he said: ""i'll be in good shape and fresh without another 10 tests on the clock. ""from what i witnessed at close quarters on sunday in our heineken cup match against leicester, i certainly didn't feel out of place alongside those players, many of whom will be on the trip.

""it has been frustrating but he is on the mend, he has made good progress."" last week williams, along with fellow flanker colin charvis - who is unlikely to play for at least a month while he recovers from a foot injury - was all but ruled out of the millennium stadium clash. with williams initially thought to be struggling, the signs pointed towards wales coach mike ruddock handing a first cap to former wales under-21 skipper richie pugh. cardiff blues flanker williams, 29, offers considerable experience and if he is declared fit then ruddock might be tempted to include him in the back row. charvis will be reviewed by the wales medical staff next monday, but davies admitted that there was only an ""outside chance"" of him being fit to face france"

""john is a young man with a big future. he has been playing with the blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock,"" said ruddock. ""he has international size, is a big, physical lad and a good ball-carrier with a high tackle-count."" ruddock's assessment was backed up by yapp's coach at the blues, former wales and lions prop dai young.

""imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least i can say is that he didn't make a thundering comeback against wales,"" said laporte.

""i'm not a racist and i've never lacked sporting decorum. i've never done that and i have medals for sporting merit."" aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team-mate and spanish international jose reyes last october. the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones, but was then requested to do so by spain's anti-violence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about â£22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger, who was fined â£15,000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating, believes that aragones' punishment was too lenient.

""but if they accept the federation's ruling we will go before the court of arbitration for sport,"" he added. kenteris's lawyer, gregory ioannidis, reacted angrily to pound's comments.

""basically, things didn't go england's way and, in typical fashion, they make more of it when they believe they've lost unfairly."" england are second bottom in the six nations table following defeats by wales, france and ireland. but although campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament, he insisted england were ""no longer world class"".

""it would be irresponsible to put him straight into a test match,"" andrew told the times. wilkinson is recovering from a knee injury which followed long-term neck and arm injuries. he has not played for england since the world cup final in november 2003, since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches. wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on 13 march. that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland.

3,"fa charges liverpool and millwall. liverpool and millwall have been charged by the football association over crowd trouble during their carling cup match on 26 october. millwall, who lost the match 3-0, have also been charged over alleged racist behaviour by their supporters. during the match at millwall's new den stadium, seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. a disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation. liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the hillsborough disaster, where 96 supporters were crushed to death in april 1989. but lions chairman theo paphitis has denied the claims. he has said cctv footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a liverpool fan attacking a millwall fan in the west stand. however, millwall have been charged with two breaches of fa rules. they have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and/or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch. liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening and/or violent and/or provocative behaviour. both clubs have until 23 december to"

""our goal is to match every side we face and against ireland we showed we could do that,"" said kirwan. ""but the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play wales on saturday."" italy's half-backs had a mixed afternoon, with recalled scrum-half alessandro troncon impressing but fly-half luciano orquera having an off-day with the boot. kirwan said: ""i was very happy with troncon. he had an incredible game - he was very good in attack and defence. ""orquera's kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence. ""he also followed the game plan. we have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well."""
3,"italy 8-38 wales. wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome. tries from jonathan thomas, tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain, shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and michael owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in. stephen jones, who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson's heroics against england, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute. henson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver"

""at 3-0 we faced a real struggle, but 3-1 at least gives us a chance."" goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals, and wenger said: ""we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment."" wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself, adding: ""but there is enough time for crying. i could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on.

3,"chelsea hold arsenal. a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury. thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry's quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas' knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry's opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and, with his back to goal, henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch, turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes. gunners keeper manuel almunia, who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann, did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry's powered header from the resultant corner"

""we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists,"" said professor kerstin dautenhahn, project leader at hertfordshire. ""our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans."" the research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. ""without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds,"" professor dautenhahn told bbc news online.

""it's the bravest move they have made yet,"" said jonny evans, news editor at macworld magazine. mr evans said the combination of low cost, small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success. he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware.

4,"bond game fails to shake or stir. for gaming fans, the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour. adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game, for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original's massive sense of fun. this however is not a sequel, nor does it relate to the goldeneye film. you are the eponymous renegade spy, an agent who deserts to the bond world's extensive ranks of criminal masterminds, after being deemed too brutal for mi6. your new commander-in-chief is the portly auric goldfinger, last seen in 1964, but happily running around bent on world domination. with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner's similarly-titled theme song, the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury, which enables a degree of x-ray vision. rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments, squashed by a plummeting helicopter. the notion is of course to add a"

4,"us woman sues over ink cartridges. a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. ""the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,"" the suit said. the lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months. the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as â£34 but it could cost"

""historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,"" said dr michael bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab.

4,"itunes user sues apple over ipod. a user of apple's itunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an ipod to play songs. he says apple is breaking anti-competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site. apple, which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the ipod in 2001, uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the ipod. californian thomas slattery filed the suit in the us district court in san jose and is seeking damages. ""apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice,"" the lawsuit states. the key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like itunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market, according to ernest gellhorn, an anti-trust law professor at george mason university.

4,"us peer-to-peer pirates convicted. the first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the us. new yorker william trowbridge and texan michael chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. the two men faced charges following raids in august on suspected pirates by the fbi. the pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (â£130,000) fine. in a statement the us department of justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the direct connect peer-to-peer network. the piracy group called itself the underground network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. direct connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. during its investigation fbi agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 ""sound recordings"" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. the raids were organised under the umbrella of operation digital gridlock which was aimed at fighting ""criminal copyright theft"
4,"hollywood campaign hits websites. movie studio efforts to stop pirated films being shared on peer-to-peer networks have claimed a high-profile victim. the campaign of legal action is thought to be behind the closure of the widely used suprnova.org website. the site was the most popular place for people swapping and sharing links for the bittorrent network. a recent study showed that more than half of the peer-to-peer traffic during june was for the bittorrent system. in a message posted on suprnova.org on sunday, the site's controllers said the site was ""closing down for good in the way that we all know it"". if the site did return, the message said, it would not be hosting any more torrent links. it continued: ""we are very sorry for this, but there was no other way, we have tried everything. "" the only parts that would keep going, said the operators of the suprnova site, were the discussion forums and net chat channels. the site is thought to have closed following an announcement by the motion picture association of america that it was launching legal action against those operating bittorrent servers rather than end users. because of the way that bittorrent works, server sites do not host"

4,"warning over tsunami aid website. net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. however, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. the link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. the message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. patricia sanders, spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down. she said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the"

4,"go-ahead for new internet names. the internet could soon have two new domain names, aimed at mobile services and the jobs market. the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann) has given preliminary approval to two new addresses - .mobi and .jobs. they are among 10 new names being considered by the net's oversight body. others include a domain for pornography, an anti-spam domain as well as .post and .travel, for the postal and travel industries. the .mobi domain would be aimed at websites and other services that work specifically around mobile phones, while the .jobs address could be used by companies wanting a dedicated site for job postings. the process to see the new domain names go live in cyberspace could take months and icann officials warned that there were no guarantees they would ultimately be accepted. applicants paid â£23,000 apiece to have their proposals considered. the application for .mobi was sponsored by technology firms including nokia, microsoft and t-mobile. of the 10 currently under consideration, the least likely to win approval is the .xxx domain for pornographic websites. there are currently around 250 domain names in use around the globe, mostly for specific countries such as .fr for france and .uk for"

""t-mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were able to take corrective action immediately,"" peter dobrow, a t-mobile spokesperson said. it is thought that mr jacobsen's hacking campaign took place over at least seven months during which time he read e-mails and personal computer files, according to court records. although mr jacobsen, 21, managed to get hold of some data, it is thought he failed to get customer credit card numbers which are stored on a separate computer system, said mr dobrow. t-mobile confirmed that the us secret service was also looking into whether the hacker accessed photos that t-mobile subscribers had taken with their camera phones. the associated press agency reported that mr jacobsen also"
4,"china 'to overtake us net use'. the chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years, says a report. china's net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country's 1.3 billion people. market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the 137 million us users of the net by 2008. the report says that the country's culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations. already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations, said william makower, chief executive of panlogic. in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare. this, combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed, helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china. only 36% of chinese homes have telephones according to reports.

4,"domain system opens door to scams. a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned. the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says stephen dyer, director of ukif. domain names are the ""real language"" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so, for example, website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users"
4,"apple ipod family expands market. apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players. its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb. the company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family. the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of â£40. the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design. during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold, 10 million of which were apple ipods. but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store, which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. mike mcguire, a research director at analyst gartner, told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in ""sealing off the market from competition"" so far.

4,"new delay hits eu software laws. a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer-based inventions. the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. ""there was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. but in the end we could not put it on,"" an eu spokesman told the reuters agency. he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law. in december, poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. poland is a large eu member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with"

4,"anti-tremor mouse stops pc shakes. a special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed. the device uses similar ""steady cam"" technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements. people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen. about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition, said the uk national tremor foundation.

4,"disney backs sony dvd technology. a next generation dvd technology backed by sony has received a major boost. film giant disney says it will produce its future dvds using sony's blu-ray disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by toshiba. the two competing dvd formats, blu-ray developed by sony and others, and toshiba's hd-dvd, have been courting top film studios for several months. the next generation of dvds promises very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. both technologies use a blue laser to write information. it has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s betamax versus vhs war. sony lost out to jvc in that fight. the current battle for hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. last month, paramount, universal and warner brothers said they were opting for the toshiba and nec-backed format, hd-dvd high-definition discs. those studios currently produce about 45% of dvd content. sony pictures entertainment and mgm studios have already"
4,"ultra fast wi-fi nears completion. ultra high speed wi-fi connections moved closer to reality on thursday when intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year. intel is developing ultra-wideband technology (uwb) which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs. uwb is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless usb devices which need low power consumption. a rival uwb standard is being developed by motorola and chip firm freescale. at the mobile phone conference 3gsm in cannes last month samsung demonstrated a phone using uwb technology from freescale. at a press conference on thursday intel announced that two uwb groups, wimedia alliance and multi-band ofdm alliance had merged to support the technology. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second.

""a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate, secure online access to information,"" said project manager livio costantini. iaea inspectors make around 3,000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide. they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants, to carry out environmental checks, and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility. the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits, for instance, was built in the 1970s and largely paper based. an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade"
4,"ds aims to touch gamers. the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo, however, is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played. the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens, and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable, while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave"

4,"ask jeeves joins web log market. ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs. the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed. bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs, makers of the blogger software, in 2003. in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone, vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us, said"

4,"putting a face to 'big brother'. literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets. imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. some of these ideas have been showcased at the london's science museum, as part of its future face exhibition. one such avatar is jeremiah. it is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer. his creator, richard bowden, lecturer at the centre for vision, speech and signal processing at the university of surrey, refers to jeremiah as ""him"", rather than it.

4,"camera phones are 'must-haves'. four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts gartner. globally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly ""must-have"" buy. in europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. by 2008, according to gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them. camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different"
4,"the future in your pocket. if you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun. the relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. to begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3g) mobile phones become inescapable. the 3 network launched in 2003, vodafone launched its consumer service in november, orange followed in early december and t-mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up. already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. ""show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and i'll write their obituary"" said niel"
4,"podcasts mark rise of diy radio. an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. it is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. a podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. they need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free. using technology based on xml computer code and rss - really simple syndication - listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software, which mr curry has pioneered. the latest mp3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically. mr curry records, hosts, edits and produce a daily, 40 minute podcast called the daily source code. he"
4,"bad e-mail habits sustains spam. the 'bad behaviour' of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found. according to a survey conducted by security firm mirapoint and market research company the radicati group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. one in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts. the fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. ""this preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us,"" said marcel nienhuis, market analyst at the radicati group. ""it explains why e-mail security threats including spam, viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate,"" he said, accusing users of ""bad e-mail behaviour"". spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month, according to security firm clearswift. it has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney sony psp giveaways. and, in perhaps a nod to the popularity of"
4,"musicians 'upbeat' about the net. musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found. the study by us researchers, pew internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing. while most considered file-sharing as illegal, many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders. ""even successful artists don't think the lawsuits will benefit musicians,"" said report author mary madden. for part of the study, pew internet conducted an online survey of 2,755 musicians, songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004. they ranged from full-time, successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music. ""we looked at more of the independent musicians, rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry,"" ms madden told the bbc news website. ""we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented."" the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet, rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. almost all of them used the net for ideas"
4,"speak easy plan for media players. music and film fans will be able to control their digital media players just by speaking to them, under plans in development by two us firms. scansoft and gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control. they want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car, or at home or on the move. huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard. ""voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections,"" said ross blanchard, vice president of business development for gracenote. ""these applications will radically change the car entertainment experience, allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel,"" he added. gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as apple's itunes. the new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection, just by saying its name. users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion, or a film just by saying the actor's name.

4,"media gadgets get moving. pocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005, according to industry experts. last year saw the emergence of portable media players, such as the windows-based creative zen portable media player, the samsung yepp, the iriver pmc-100, and the archos av400 series among others. but this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them. archos launched its latest range of its linux-based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday. dubbed the pocket media assistant pma430, it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. ""consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access,"" said henri crohas, chief of archos. ""and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time."" archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people's pockets, after the mobile. unlike windows-based players, the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source, such as tvs, as well as playback. the content put onto"

4,"format wars could 'confuse users'. technology firms sony, philips, matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video. the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy. currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy ""appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content"". the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought."

4,"consumers 'snub portable video'. consumers want music rather than movies while on the move, says a report. produced by jupiter research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of europeans want to watch video while out and about. by contrast, almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an ipod. the firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible. the report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of europe's portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two. barely 5% of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies. only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video. ""dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in europe today despite their high prices,"" said ian fogg, jupiter analyst. mr fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device.

""there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres."" mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said mr king. this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale. malcolm seagrave, security expert at energis, said the most common types of"

4,"lifestyle 'governs mobile choice'. faster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests. instead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company ericsson. ""historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,"" said dr michael bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. ""we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,"" he said.

""the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,"" the suit said. the lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months. the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as â£34 but it could cost"

4,"britons fed up with net service. a survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service. they are fed up with slow speeds, high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. it is particularly bad news for bt, the uk's biggest internet supplier, with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining. a third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton, editor of pc pro magazine. ""we expect these figures to leap in 2005. every month the prices drop, and more and more people are trying to switch,"" he said. the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping. other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are"

""all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe,"" mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website. ""japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years' time.

4,"halo fans' hope for sequel. xbox video game halo 2 has been released in the us on 9 november, with a uk release two days later. why is the game among the most anticipated of all time? halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. a science fiction epic, halo centred the action on a human cyborg, controlled by the player, who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. remembrance of things past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as larry niven's ringworld and the film starship troopers, it fit the bill perfectly. halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive, had tremendous audio, using dolby digital, a decent storyline, instant playability and impressive physics. but what marked halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video"
4,"eu software patent law delayed. controversial new eu rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from poland. poland - a large and therefore crucial eu member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software. critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones. they say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software. polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. the planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the eu should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the us. so, for instance, us-based amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping'. critics claim the law, which the eu says is needed to harmonise with the us, is little more than a law on ideas. ""patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected,"" eva lichtenberg, a austrian green member of the european parliament said"
4,"online commons to spark debate. online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust, says the institute of public policy research (ippr). existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services, says the think-tank. although the net is becoming part of local and central government, its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online ""commons"" for public debate. in its report, is online community a policy tool?, the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities. adopting an ebay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection. ""what we are proposing is a civic commons,"" will davies, senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website. ""a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion."" the idea of a ""civic commons"" was originally proposed by stephen coleman, professor of e-democracy at the oxford internet institute. the ippr report points to"
4,"uk gets official virus alert site. a rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the uk government. the service, it safe, will issue warnings about damaging viruses, software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. the service will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. the scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. the government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year, based on previous experience of virus outbreaks. ""there is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work,"" said home office minister hazel blears. ""the purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm."" those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people. full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many"
4,"blogs take on the mainstream. web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow. these online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. the most well-known examples include iraqi salam pax's accounts of the us-led war, former iranian vice-president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign. there are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last november. the blogging movement has been building up for many years. andrew nachison, director of the media center, a us-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the us presidential race"
4,"seamen sail into biometric future. the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony, currently in the gulf of mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric id cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. along with the owner's picture, name and personal details, the new seafarers' identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year, in line with the revised un convention on seafarers' identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the international labour organisation (ilo) by the end of november. crystal cruises, which operates the crystal harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. authenti-corp, the us technology consultancy, has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards.

4,"napster offers rented music to go. music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business. the cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music. ""music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,"" said paul myers, chief executive of wippit, a uk-based music download service. while itunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to ipod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed napster to go in the uk in the next few months. the service can be used on players that support"
4,"software watching while you work. software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a pc but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled. worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. the developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. but privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software. the system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists bridgehead software. they have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity, store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hi-tech crime unit (nhtcu) a survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove, to a legal standard, that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with. ironically the impetus for developing the"
4,"spam e-mails tempt net shoppers. computer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods, a report suggests. more than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery. as well as profiting from selling goods or services and driving advertising traffic, organised crime rings can use spam to glean personal information. the business software alliance (bsa) warned that people should ""stay alert"". ""many online consumers don't consider the true motives of spammers,"" said mike newton, a spokesperson for the bsa which commissioned the survey. ""by selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites, spammers are hiding spyware without consumers' knowledge. ""once the software is installed on pcs and networks, information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused."" the results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low, at one in 10. the research, which covered 6,000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails, revealed that brazilians were the most likely to read spam. a third of them read"
4,"apple makes blogs reveal sources. apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products. the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december 2004 following online articles about apple's asteroid product. now apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. a lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters. apple's lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage, apple insider and think secret websites. all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. the lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the power page and apple insider sites. the separate legal fight with think secret has yet to be resolved. in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg, apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers'"
4,"mobiles rack up 20 years of use. mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend. britain's first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise. in the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of britons own a handset. mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline. the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. the first call was made from st katherine's dock to vodafone's head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house. for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk. then on 10 january cellnet (now o2) launched its service. mike caudwell, spokesman for vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size"
4,"mobile networks seek turbo boost. third-generation mobile (3g) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week. fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the global mobile suppliers association. at 3gsm, siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (kbps) on standard 3g networks. ""high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,"" according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies"
4,"digital uk driven by net and tv. the uk's adoption of digital tv and broadband has helped make it the fourth most digitally-savvy nation in europe, according a report by jupiter research. but the uk still lags in terms of broadband speeds compared to others. the most digitally sophisticated europeans, in terms of use of digital goods such as mobiles, tv, net and cameras, are the scandinavians. about 14 million households in the uk, 60%, have digital tv, according to the communications regulator ofcom. the least digital of the european nations was greece, in 17th position, according to the digital life index. scandinavian countries sweden, denmark and norway came out top in the report, but there were some differences in technology trends. ""the european digital life index demonstrates that digital lifestyles are common today, but across europe there is no single digital lifestyle,"" said nate elliott, jupiter analyst. ""consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries."" although there are differences between different european nations, the gap between them is closing, the report concluded. the trend for gadgets and technologies, such as digital video recorders (dvr), broadband, and video-on-demand will continue across europe, he added. more than six million uk households now have broadband net. by"
4,"how to make a gigapixel picture. the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands. the finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot. if printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution, the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long. the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. the website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200,000 visitors every day. the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge. the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003. that image portrayed bryce canyon"
4,"'no re-draft' for eu patent law. a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps. the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review ""all aspects of the directive"". the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, ""computer implemented invention"". in a letter, ec president jos&#233; manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament, josep borrell, that the commission ""did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers)"" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004. if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation"
